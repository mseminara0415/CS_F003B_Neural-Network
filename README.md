# **CS_F003B_Neural-Network**

## Class Objective
Using OOP principles and design methods, build a Neural Network from scratch.
<br/>
<br/>

## Components & Functionality of an NN
A Neural Network is made up of 3 components:
- Input Layer
- Hidden (computation) Layers
- Output Layer<br />

The learning happens in two steps:
- Forward-Propagation
- Back-Propagation<br />

This means we are making a guess (forward-propagation) and then
minimizing the error between the actual answer and the guessed value (back-propagation)...Rinse and repeat.


## Well what exactly does a Neural Network look like??
_Example of an NN with 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output layer nodes._<br />
